1)print list of existing local user's and their homedirectory on console in following format (use awk with /etc/passwd file)
user1 - /home/user1
user2 - /home/user2


# awk -F: '{print $1 " - " $6}' /etc/passwd
root - /root
bin - /bin
daemon - /sbin
adm - /var/adm
lp - /var/spool/lpd
sync - /sbin
shutdown - /sbin
halt - /sbin
mail - /var/spool/mail
operator - /root
games - /usr/games
ftp - /var/ftp
nobody - /
systemd-network - /
dbus - /
rpc - /var/lib/rpcbind
libstoragemgmt - /var/run/lsm
sshd - /var/empty/sshd
rpcuser - /var/lib/nfs
nfsnobody - /var/lib/nfs
ec2-instance-connect - /home/ec2-instance-connect
postfix - /var/spool/postfix
chrony - /var/lib/chrony
tcpdump - /
ec2-user - /home/ec2-user

or 
# awk -F: '{print $1 " -user home directory is " $6}' /etc/passwd
root -user home directory is /root
bin -user home directory is /bin
daemon -user home directory is /sbin
adm -user home directory is /var/adm
lp -user home directory is /var/spool/lpd
sync -user home directory is /sbin
shutdown -user home directory is /sbin
halt -user home directory is /sbin
mail -user home directory is /var/spool/mail
operator -user home directory is /root
games -user home directory is /usr/games
ftp -user home directory is /var/ftp
nobody -user home directory is /
systemd-network -user home directory is /
dbus -user home directory is /
rpc -user home directory is /var/lib/rpcbind
libstoragemgmt -user home directory is /var/run/lsm
sshd -user home directory is /var/empty/sshd
rpcuser -user home directory is /var/lib/nfs
nfsnobody -user home directory is /var/lib/nfs
ec2-instance-connect -user home directory is /home/ec2-instance-connect
postfix -user home directory is /var/spool/postfix
chrony -user home directory is /var/lib/chrony
tcpdump -user home directory is /
ec2-user -user home directory is /home/ec2-user


2) Create file data.txt with below line. You need to replace "Nilesh" with your name in single command without opening file. (use sed)
This is Nilesh and I am mad.

# more data.txt
Avinash is father of Vihaan
sed -i 's/Avinash/Avi/' data.txt
# more data.txt
Avi is father of Vihaan

?? How to change more than 2 words with sed ?? 

3) Create bash script to Fetch list of uniq ip's with total number of request from that ip from access.log file. (hint - awk, wc, sort, uniq)
i.e.
83.149.9.216 - 23

# cat access.log
#!/bin/bash
83.149.9.216 - 23
123.786.234.90 - 24
1.2.3 - 25
4.5.6 - 28
4.5.6 - 28

# uniq -c access.log           
      1 #!/bin/bash
      1 83.149.9.216 - 23
      1 123.786.234.90 - 24
      1 1.2.3 - 25
      2 4.5.6 - 28


-c, --count prefix lines by the number of occurrences

# wc access.log 
 6 16 83 access.log                 ( 6 lines , 16 column , 83 words ) 
 
 # sort access.log
1.2.3 - 25
123.786.234.90 - 24
4.5.6 - 28
4.5.6 - 28
83.149.9.216 - 23
#!/bin/bash


??awk - not getting ??


4) create bash script which will ping each website mentioned in website.txt and get it's ipv4/ipv6 and create website-detail.txt with website and it's ip address in below format. (hint - use for loop, ping website, use awk to get ip)
google.com [2404:6800:4009:80a::200e]

# cat website.txt

5) Write a bash script which will check /tmp/test directory exist or not, if directory not exist then it will create directory. (Hint - read question again)
Â© 2020 GitHub, Inc.
create 1 file 
#  cat /tmp/avinash
I love my INDIA

# cat file_exist.txt
FILE=/tmp/avinash
if test -f "$FILE"; then
    echo "$FILE exists."
fi

#./file_exist.txt
/tmp/avinash exists.

# cat file_exist.txt   ------------------- (/tmp/avinash_1 file is not created) 
FILE=/tmp/avinash_1
if test -f "$FILE"; then
    echo "$FILE exists."
else
    echo "$FILE is not exists."
fi

# ./file_exist.txt
/tmp/avinash_1 is not exists.


# cat file_exist.txt
filename=/tmp/avinash_1
if [ ! -f $filename ]
then
    touch $filename
fi

# ./file_exist.txt

# cd /tmp
]# ls -lrth avinash
avinash    avinash_1


6) Create a bash script with six function usage, add, sub, mul, div, and get below input from user and as per the operation show output.
    #What operation they want to perform (add,sub,mul,div), if user enter other than that it should execute usage funtion and exit the program.
    #get num1
    #get num2
